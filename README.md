# Real-time-price-compare

Most sites that compare the price of products on different e-commerce websites tend to store data in database/json files which makes a price comparison site pretty heavy.
<br>
This project provides the Real time analysis of products on flipkart and amazon. It uses web scraping as a key idea to extract data and deploy without the use of databases or json files.
