# Real-time-price-compare
**NOTE- Please update the Class tag and ID tag.

Most sites that compare the price of products on different e-commerce websites tend to store data in database/json files which makes a price comparison site pretty heavy.
<br>
This project provides the Real time analysis of products on flipkart and amazon. It uses web scraping to extract data and deploy without using databases or json files.
